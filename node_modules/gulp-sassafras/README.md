### Introduction

Sassafras is a tool for compiling multiple CSS preprocessors into browser-readable CSS (and it minifies your JavaScript too!). Currently Sassafras can handle Sass and LESS and will actively watch your project's files to actively compile your code. More preprocessors and awesome features like automatic vendor prefixing are coming soon!

#### Prerequisites  
All of Sassafras's tasks are run through gulp, and thus you'll need to have gulp up and running on your system.

    npm install -g gulp

Just to make sure everything's up and running, run `gulp --version`. If your terminal returns a version number for the local version and the CLI, you're golden!

**If you're met with an error, something may be wrong with your gulp install. Check out the gulp  [docs](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) for more info.**

### Installation

If you were able to get gulp up and running without any issues, then you're ready to install the package. Everything is managed through [bower](http://bower.io/), so installation is as simple as running the command below.

    bower install sassafras

You should see a `bower_components` folder in the root of your project. All you have to do is navigate to the `dist` folder and move it's contents to the root of your project directory. Then run `npm install` and you're done! This will install all of the gulp dependencies to get your project up and running.  

## Usage

Once you've got everything installed and in the right directory, running Sassafras is quick and easy. All you have to do is run one simple command:

    gulp

I'd suggest opening a new tab in your terminal window where Sassafras can run its tasks without interfering with anything you may need to do in the CL.

## Additional Info

Right now, Sassafras has a pretty specific file tree that you'll need to follow it you want it to work out of the box. Sassafras watches for changes in a `dist` folder in the root of your project. It then watches for changes in an `assets` folder with CSS belonging to the `styles` folder and JS belonging to the `scripts` folder.

If that was confusing, here's Sassafras's default paths for watching tasks:
```
// Watches
dist/assets/styles/*.scss
dist/assets/styles/*.less

// Compiles into
dist/assets/styles/*.css

// Watches
dist/assets/scripts/*.js

// Minifies JS into
dist/assets/scripts/*.min.j
```
The tree is set up like this because it follows my model for development. This may work for you, it may not, but fret not! Editing the paths to suit your needs is super easy

### Editing the paths
For example:
```js
// Link task
gulp.task('lint', function(){
  return gulp.src('dist/assets/scripts/*.js')
    .pipe(jshint())
    .pipe(jshint.reporter('default'));
});

// Compile Sass
gulp.task('sass', function(){
  return gulp.src('dist/assets/styles/*.scss')
    .pipe(sass())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/assets/styles'));
});

// Compile LESS
gulp.task('less', function(){
  return gulp.src('dist/assets/styles/*.less')
    .pipe(less())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/assets/styles'));
});
```
Could become:
```js
// Link task
gulp.task('lint', function(){
  return gulp.src('src/doodles/js/*.js')
    .pipe(jshint())
    .pipe(jshint.reporter('default'));
});

// Compile Sass
gulp.task('sass', function(){
  return gulp.src('src/doodles/scss/*.scss')
    .pipe(sass())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/assets/styles'));
});

// Compile LESS
gulp.task('less', function(){
  return gulp.src('src/doodles/less/*.less')
    .pipe(less())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/assets/styles'));
});
```

### Todo
- [ ] Add support for Compass and Stylus
- [x] Automatic vendor prefixing
- [x] Live browser reloading upon task running
